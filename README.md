- The dataset is taken from sklearn.datasets (from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing).
- House_price_pred.py is a demo of using FNN, Back Propagation to predict California house price and the accuracy of the prediction model.
- House_price_pred_ES.py is quite similar besides the Early Stopping implementation to better improve the model.
- The 2 graphs show the convergence process of Loss functions (MSE) of the 2 method.
- Libraries that need to be installed from your IDE terminal: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- It would be great if you guys can leave me some feedbacks lol
